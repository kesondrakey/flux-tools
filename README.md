# fluxtools v0.3.0

Interactive Shiny application for QA/QC for eddy covariance data processing.  
Designed to streamline the post‐processing of eddy covariance datasets (e.g., after EddyPro, physical boundary filtering) to detect and remove outliers, and generate reproducible R code for QA/QC public repository submission (i.e., AmeriFlux).

## Key Features

- **Interactive Scatter Plot**  
  Choose any numeric variable for X (often `TIMESTAMP_START`) and Y; drag a box or lasso to flag points

- **Multi-Year Support**  
  Upload up to 100 MB of flux‐tower CSV (all years by default, or pick a subset)

- **Dark/Light Mode**  
  Toggle UI theme on the fly (switch is in the bottom-right of the side panel)

- **±σ Outlier Highlighting**  
  Use the slider to mark points beyond N standard deviations from a linear fit; click **Select ±σ outliers** to add them

- **Accumulate & Undo**  
  - **Select data** current selection to an accumulated list across variables
  - **Clear Selection** individual points or clear outliers and selections

- **Confirm Removal**  
  Hit **Apply removals** to convert flagged Y-values to `NA` in your data frame and immediately refresh the plot.

- **Export Cleaned Data**  
  Download a .csv with removed points set to `NA` plus an R-script of all your removal code in one go.
